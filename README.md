QR Clip
=======

A simple app which shows the contents of the clipboard as a QR code.
The primary use case is to scan it with your smartphone, i.e. it's
basically a quick way to transfer some text from your computer to
your phone when you need it.

Ctrl+C copies the QR code image to the clipboard, Ctrl+S saves it to
a PNG file.

That's all. Nice and simple.
